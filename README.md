# - last-N-days
A python script to query a cluster for N days of ingest.  

Note: This first version looks at the average doc size across the cluster, and then goes for each of the last N days, and finds a doc count, and multiplies out to establish an ingest rate.

# - openai-elastic-examples
a couple examples of datasets which can be uploaded to elasticsearch, with a python UI that will let you query elasticsearch and also pass contents to openAI for an example of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
